          In my never-ending pursuit of knowledge and experience,
          I have traveled many roads and worn many hats.
          I feel these experiences make me a strong candidate to
          find the unique and elegant solutions you desire.
          <br><br>
          At Oppia, I have had the continued opportunity to work
          and share ideas with a team of Google developers and,
          through this interaction, their processes and standards
          have been embedded into my work. The music staff widget
          I created for this project is strongly suited to teach music
          theory and complex harmony in an intuitive and fun way.
          Having just completed App Academyâ€™s intense boot camp,
          I have expanded my knowledge base immensely while also applying
          these skills daily to solve common problems that developers often
          encounter. Additionally, my experiences as a musician have taught
          me the life skills needed to interact with team-members and clients
          in a way that brings out the best in people. I always strive for
          clarity and have found that the simplest components are usually
          best for expressing the most complex ideas.
